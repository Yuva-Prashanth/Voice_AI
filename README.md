# Overview
React Voice AI is a web application built with React JS, CSS, and components that allows users to interact with the application using voice commands. The application uses the lan-sdk-web library for speech recognition and supports custom hooks for integrating voice commands with different components.

# Features
- Speech recognition using lan-sdk-web library
- Custom hooks for integrating voice commands with components
- Easy to use UI with smooth navigation and animations
- Support for various voice commands for performing different tasks

# Installation
To run the application, clone the repository to your local machine and run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.

Then, run npm start to start the development server.

# Usage
To use the voice commands, make sure to grant microphone access to the application. Then, simply speak the voice command to trigger the associated task or action.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
